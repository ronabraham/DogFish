		/* Chess Notation on a standard 8*8 chess board deems the bottom right hand corner square as 
		 * being WHITE and hence extending the rule through alternate colors,
		 * the top left hand corner also will be a WHITE square .
		 * Using a simple 8*8 Array for Board layout, the top left hand corner WHITE square is 
		 * at the following position board_layout[7][0]
		 *  i.e 8th rank on the chess board is the 7th row in the Array, 
		 *  and the square on the first file is at 0th position
